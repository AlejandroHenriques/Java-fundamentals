Day 4 – Methods with arguments and return values

Topics covered:
- Method arguments (parameters)
- Methods that return values
- Using return to send results back

Key ideas:
- Arguments allow methods to receive data
- Return values allow methods to give a result
- A method can only return one value
- The return type must match the method signature

Exercises practiced:
- Multiplication table using a method
- Calculate the third angle of a triangle given two angles

Examples (logic):
- A method that receives a number and prints its multiplication table
- A method that receives two angles and returns the third angle:
  - thirdAngle = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)

Notes:
- Methods help organize logic and make code reusable
- Returning values is useful when the result is needed later

Questions / To review:
- When should a method be void vs return a value?
- Can a method both print and return a value?
