Topics covered:
- Creating and running a Java class using Eclipse
- Writing a Multiplication Table program in Eclipse
- Refactoring code using Eclipse tools
- Debugging Java programs with Eclipse

1. First Java class with Eclipse:
- Created a new Java project
- Created a new class inside the project
- Used the main method as the entry point
- Ran the program directly from Eclipse
- Understood that Eclipse compiles automatically

Key idea:
Eclipse simplifies compilation and execution compared to using javac and java manually.

2. Multiplication Table Program:
- Created a method to print multiplication tables
- Used loops (for loop)
- Practiced organizing logic inside methods
- Improved readability compared to writing everything in main

3. Programming Tip 1 – Refactoring:
- Refactoring means improving code structure without changing behavior
- Used Eclipse to:
  - Rename variables
  - Extract methods
- Helps keep code clean and maintainable
- Important for writing professional code

4. Programming Tip 2 – Debugging:
- Used breakpoints to pause execution
- Stepped through code line by line
- Observed variable values during execution
- Learned how to find logical errors

Key concepts learned:
- IDEs increase productivity
- Clean code matters
- Debugging is a skill, not just fixing errors
- Small improvements (refactoring) make code better long-term
